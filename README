This is a bash script to scan a series of pages from a document into a pdf, at the end of the pdf is the output from OCR on each page.

This provides the original scan but also something searchable, e.g. for use in google desktop.

I played around with tesseract, very good OCR but no layout analisys!! so cuneiform it is.

This was built and tested on a gnome machine but i dont see any reason for it to fail on kde or non linux OSs as long as dependancies are met, feedback on this would be welcome.


To install, currently only manual install:

Download and copy the script to a location such as /usr/bin/
$ wget http://github.com/dougle/scan-OCR-pdf/raw/master/scan_ocr_pdf -o /usr/bin/scan_ocr_pdf && \
  chmod +x /usr/bin/scan_ocr_pdf

You can then add it to your panel or applications menu or run it in a terminal using the command:

$ scan_ocr_pdf -d "$HOME/Documents/Scanned"

OPTIONS:
   -h      Show this message
   -d      Destination directory
   -r      Resolution to use while scanning,
           (can cause cuneiform to buffer overflow when set too high)
   -u      Use this device for scanning, instead of the first scanner listed
           See   $ scanimage -L    for your devices
   -g      Interface mode, prompts use zenity
   -s      Options to pass to scanimage. Default is:
           "--mode 'Color'  -l 0 -t 0 -x 210 -y 297" (colour A4 area)




To debug simple add -x to the first line:
#!/bin/bash -x

This'll add a line by line transcription of the execution and would be usefull in any weird/occasional bugs.



More options and features will be added soon, like a simple zenity OK/Cancel interface
Forks, Patches, Feature requests, Bug reports, comments welome.
