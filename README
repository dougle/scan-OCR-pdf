This is a bash script to scan a series of pages from a document into a pdf, at the end of the pdf is the output from OCR on each page.

This provides the original scan but also something searchable, e.g. for use in google desktop.

I played around with tesseract, very good OCR but no layout analisys!! so cuneiform it is.

This was built and tested on a gnome machine but i dont see any reason for it to fail on kde or non linux OSs, feedback on this would be welcome.


To install, currently only manual install:

Download and copy the script to a location such as /usr/bin/
$ wget http://github.com/dougle/scan-OCR-pdf/raw/master/scan_ocr_pdf -o /usr/bin/scan_ocr_pdf && \
  chmod +x /usr/bin/scan_ocr_pdf

You can then add it to your panel or applications menu or run it in a terminal using the command:

$ scan_ocr_pdf "$HOME/Documents/Scanned"




More options and features will be added soon, like a simple zenity OK/Cancel interface
Forks, Patches, Feature requests, Bug reports, comments welome.
